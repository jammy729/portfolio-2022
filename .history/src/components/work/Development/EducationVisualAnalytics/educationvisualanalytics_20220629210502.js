          The right to education is one of the key principles in our life and
          everyone should have the same opportunity to receive the education
          they need. Using data visualization, we will explore if there are
          parental levels of education and parental income can have an influence
          on a student's performance in school and graduation rate. And if these
          are factors, identify the patterns and address the issue.

          I choose this data visualization because I was interested in how
          parental level of education and income can influence child performance
          in school and years to graduate. I have the amazing privilege of
          living in Canada and receive education as well as In this data
          visualization, we are focusing on whether parental level of education
          and income can influence child performance in school and years to
          graduate.

          I have used two datasets from Royce Kimmons and the datasets are

          The two dataset had some dimensions that were not needed in this
          visualization or to answer the domain questions so I cleaned dataset.

        1. Do parental level of education have any influence on the
        child's/student performance
        <WorkImage
          src={data1}
          alt='Histogram chart'
          caption='Histogram chart to show relationship between parental level of education and the children score'
          w='full'
        />
        have used histogram to discover the relationship between parental level of education and the
student score on the writing, reading and math test. The histogram shows the median value of individual tests
divided into sections of parental level of education. The interaction in this visualization is the ability to sort
histogram from ascending to descending. This allows the user to easily identify the extremum and also sort the
data cases.
